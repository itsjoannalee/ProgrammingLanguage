- **HW**: Homework assignments.
- **Lab**: Laboratory exercises.

## Coursework Overview

#### Bonus Assignments

- **Bonus 1**: Circle Operations
- **Objective**: Implement a `Circle` class that supports various operations including calculating area and circumference, and determining spatial relationships with points and other circles.
- **Technologies Used**: object-oriented programming principles.

- **Bonus 4**: Question and ChoiceQuestion Classes
- **Objective**: Develop a quiz system where questions can be either simple or multiple-choice, leveraging object-oriented design principles like inheritance and polymorphism.
- **Technologies Used**: inheritance, polymorphism.

- **Bonus 5**: Shape Hierarchy
- **Objective**: Create a hierarchy of shape objects (Square, Circle, Triangle) that inherit from a `Shape` abstract class, each implementing specific methods to compute area and perimeter.
- **Technologies Used**: abstract classes, method overriding, and polymorphism.

#### Labs
- **Lab 1**: Introduction to Java and basic setup.
- **Lab 2 - Lab 5**: Fundamental programming concepts including types, variables, constants, operators, and string handling.
- **Lab 6 - Lab 8**: Control structures, including loops and conditionals.
- **Lab 9**: Introduction to arrays and array lists.
- **Lab 12 - Lab 13**:  Advanced object-oriented concepts, Inheritance and interfaces, polymorphism.

#### Assignments
- **Assignment 1 - Assignment 8**: These assignments covered everything from basic Java programming, control structures, arrays, to complex object-oriented programming including inheritance and polymorphism.


## Educational Objectives

The coursework is designed to teach the application of programming knowledge in solving real-world problems using Java. It emphasizes:
- Object-Oriented Programming: Mastery of classes, inheritance, interfaces, and polymorphism.
- GUI and Event-Driven Programming: Building interactive applications.
- Data Handling: Effective management of data using Java's I/O and JDBC.
- Problem Solving: Developing solutions to complex problems using a divide and conquer approach.

## Setup

Source files are included in each sub-directory, which can be compiled and run using any standard Java development environment.
